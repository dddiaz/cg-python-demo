1. Open up IDLE  
2. You should see the interactive python shell  
3. It starts with three arrows: >>>
4. Python is an interepreted language which means you can write code, and run it instantly, without having to worry about compiling or building it. 
5. In your python shell type this (Not including the 3 arrows):
```bash
>>> print('Hello World')
```
6. Then press enter. You should see:
```bash
Hello World
```
7. Congratulations! You just ran your first bit of python code.
8. Wait! What the heck did I just do:
    - first you called a python method called print. A method is a way you can tell the computer to do certain actions. In this case, you want the computer to print something to the screen.
    - Next you passed print a string. In python there are many different kinds of variable types, but for now lets only worry about strings. strings are basically words, letters, or sentences. 
    - so now we have told python, print the string, 'hello world'
9. Ok - you should be all set up for the lunch and learn. If you have any questions feel free to leverage google, the hitchhikers guide to python, the python docs, or email me.
